# Case Study: User Rewards and In-Game Purchases Prediction

## Overview
This notebook analyzes user behavior data from a mobile game to predict future user rewards and in-game purchases. We examine user progression patterns, engagement metrics, and spending behavior to answer specific business questions about future user performance.

## Notebook Structure
This notebook is divided into 4 parts. Each section is linked to the question being asked and has more detailed comments on what has been done in them. These parts are:
* Read Data - just to read and create the dataframes
* Rewards Probability
* In App Purchases
* Suggested Adjustments to Reward Structure

## Assumptions:
- **User Behavior Consistency**: We assumed that user progression patterns and purchase behaviors would remain consistent for users starting July 1st onwards and not influenced by seasonal factors or special events.
- **Game Remains the Unchanged**: During the entire duration of data provided, we assume that there were no significant changes in game difficulty, economy, or marketing.
- **Recent trends will continue**: We assume that the recent completion rates would be more presentative of future behavior than the overall 3 month average.
- **Correlation implies causation in purchases**: We assume that strong correlation between level progression and purchase behavior indicates a causal relationship, i.e. encouraging users to reach higher levels would lead to increased purchases, rather than simply reflecting that high-spending users tend to progress further.

## Question 1: Predicted Average User Rewards (July 1st onwards)
### Grain: 
user_id - because the data shows users have reinstalled and reached the same level multiple times. In order to keep the process clean, the assumption here is the user can only achieve each milestone once, and keeping it at the user grain and using the earliest action_datetime would give us a cleaner timeline.

### Results:
For users starting from July 1st, their expected rewards in:
Month 1 average: 41.31
Month 2 average: 37.14
Month 3 average: 34.14

The rewards calculated uses expectation for better explainability. Rewards are defined in separate ways for users who complete the challenge in time, and users who are too early to know if they will or will not get there based on level progression and time left.

### Methodology:
Calculate the expected reward payout for each user based on their progression patterns. For each reward level, we compute:
The probability of a user reaching that level within the time limit
The expected reward value (probability x reward amount)
This approach uses expectation for better explainability.

## Question 2: Predicted In-Game Purchase (within 50 days)
### Grain: 
offer_start_id (given)

### Results:
Given the limited data sample we have and lack of other non-game attributes, this model doesnâ€™t perform too well and can be improved with other metadata.
Expected in-game purchase per offer: $0.98

### Methodology:
* Used two predictive models to predict expected value of in-game purchaes. The approach is:
    * Probability model to predict the likelihood of a user making a purchase
    * For users that make a purchase, prediction model to understand the amount value being spent based on game-level progression.
    * Combine the two predictions using a median value across the dataset to simulate July to get expected in-game purchase for that month.

* To maximize performance of the model, we use SMOTE to balance classes, and GridSearch across hyperparameters, using fbeta tuned for precision on the purchased rows as the scoring mechanism.

## Question 3: Recommended Task Structure Adjustments

Our analysis reveals several concerning patterns:
1. The offer completion rate is significantly low
2. There's a sharp decline in user retention after the first week
3. The current reward structure doesn't align with game difficulty progression

### Possible Hypotheses for Low Completion and High Churn:
- Game difficulty increases causing players to abandon
- Reward milestones appear unattainable, discouraging continued play
- The effort-to-reward ratio becomes increasingly unfavorable
- Players experience burnout due to the sustained high level requirements

### Proposed Structural Changes:

1. Progressive Difficulty Adjustment
- Align reward timeframes with the natural difficulty curve of the game
- Decrease the levels-per-day requirement as players progress to higher levels
- Current data shows Level 100 requires 5 levels/day while Level 175 requires 3.5 levels/day, but the latter offers less reward_per_level than reaching level 0 to 35

2. Balanced Effort-to-Reward Ratio
- Maintain or increase the reward-per-level as difficulty increases
- From our data, the reward-per-level decreases from 0.29 for Level 35 to 0.20 for Level 100, then slightly increases to 0.23 for Level 175
- This declining reward ratio likely contributes to player disengagement

3. Micro-Rewards and Engagement Hooks
- Implement smaller, more frequent rewards between major milestones to maintain interest
- Create a "streak" bonus system to encourage daily/weekly play
- Consider weekly mini-goals that align with the observed weekly engagement cycle

4. Early Retention Focus
- Front-load more attainable rewards in the first 7-10 days to combat the week-one drop-off
- Create incentives to push users through the initial difficulty curve

By restructuring rewards to better match player progression patterns and psychological motivators, we can likely improve both completion rates and overall retention, ultimately increasing the ROI for both Almeida and the game developer.
